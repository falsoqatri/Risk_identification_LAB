<h1> Risk Identification Assistant - University of Essex</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
To identify potential cyber security risks, we can start by identifying the types of threats that Pampered Pets may be vulnerable to. For example, some common cyber security risks for a company that produces pet food may include:

    Data breaches that compromise customer information
    Hacking attempts that disrupt the company's operations
    Malware or phishing attacks that compromise the company's computer systems

Once we have identified the potential risks, we can then create a code that generates an Excel spreadsheet with each risk listed along with its likelihood of occurrence, potential impact, and recommended mitigation strategies.

When you run this code, it will prompt you to enter the likelihood, impact, and recommended mitigation strategies for each potential cyber security risk. Once you have entered all of the data, the code will generate a new Excel spreadsheet called "PamperedPets_CyberSecurityRisks.xlsx" with each risk listed along with its likelihood of occurrence, potential impact, and recommended mitigation strategies.
